**4.6 SUMMARY**

This chapter has presented the comprehensive technical implementation of the NeuroÏ€ project, detailing the journey from theoretical design to a fully functional, integrated brain- computer interface platform. The work described herein demonstrates the successful translation of the four-component frameworkâ€”Data Collection, Data Preprocessing, Model Architecture, and Web Applicationâ€”into a cohesive and powerful system.

The implementation began with the Data Collection Infrastructure, which established a robust and reliable interface with the 14-channel Emotiv EPOC+ consumer EEG \[4\] headset. By developing specialized trial protocols for Motor Imagery and P300 visual paradigms, we were able to systematically capture the neural signatures required for high-performance BCI.

These raw signals were then refined through paradigm-optimized Data Preprocessing Pipelines. These pipelines employed a cascade of advanced signal processing techniques, including targeted filtering, ICA-based artifact removal, and comprehensive feature engineering, to transform noisy EEG data into high-dimensional, information-rich datasets containing over 500 features per sample.

The intellectual core of the platform resides in its dual Model Architectures. Two state-of- the-art deep learning models were successfully implemented and trained: an ATCNet architecture for Motor Imagery classification, which achieved a robust cross-validation accuracy of 75%, and a sophisticated CNN-LSTM-Attention hybrid for P300 detection. The P300 modelâ€™s exceptional performance, culminating in a 91.16% test accuracy, stands as a primary achievement of this work, proving that clinical-grade results are attainable with consumer hardware.

Finally, all these components were unified within a sophisticated Web Application Platform built on the Django framework. This platform provides an intuitive, accessible interface
