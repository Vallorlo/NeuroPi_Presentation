ðŸŽ¨ COMBINED MODEL VISUALIZATIONS SUMMARY
=======================================

âœ… Created Visualizations:
â€¢ training_progress_combined.png - Training curves and progress
â€¢ dataset_comparison.png - Original vs Combined dataset analysis
â€¢ architecture_diagram.png - Model architecture flowchart
â€¢ feature_analysis.png - Feature extraction and processing pipeline

ðŸ“Š Key Insights:
â€¢ Combined dataset increased from 1,252 to 2,005 samples
â€¢ SMOTE balancing created 6,174 balanced samples
â€¢ 500 advanced features selected through dual selection
â€¢ Ultimate architecture with 1,101,318 parameters

ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps:
â€¢ Wait for training completion
